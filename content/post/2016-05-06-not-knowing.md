+++

It is almost 4 AM. I sit down at the computer and type. The words leap from my mind onto the screen. It is almost like magic. I do not feel that it is 'I' who is doing it.

'Not knowing' is what lies beyond the edge of our knowledge. At the edge, we feel discomfort. Our bodies change physically. A layer of perspiration forms on our soles and our torsos. We pace up and down repetitively. We know, without a doubt, that we have arrived at a place where unpleasant feelings await: dread, anxiety and fear. It is a place that we try to avoid.

"Traveller, there is no road... The footsteps are the path". This is an expression, from a Spanish person, that I remember reading a few months ago in a book on the subject of 'Not knowing'. The words of the authors come to my mind now. They write that it is difficult to balance the act of informing the reader, with the subject matter itself. The book may make the authors seem like experts on 'Not knowing', but they emphasise that they are no more adept than we are at navigating the unknown. As if to hammer home the point that they are not experts, the authors have sought wisdom from various people on the endeavour of handling the unknown, in a particularly illuminating section, which is about following the wisdom of people with relevant experience, and essentially staying humble.

What drove me to such a dark place into such an uncomfortable position? Producing this post is when I encounter the unknown. Never in my personal history have I embarked on such a pursuit.

'Don't feign expertise,' the authors warned from my memories, 'as tempting as it may be'. Some bits of a professional's story bubbled up from my buried memories of the book: In his initial days in a new job, in an unfamiliar domain, he was asked to deliver a report. Although he had experience from other jobs, he did not possess the necessary information. What did he do? He asked someone else in his new company for it. He delivered the report successfully.

Would I be able to make the post funny? Who should I write the post for? How good am I as a comedian with a blog? Worry after worry flooded my mind before I could even sit down to write. Writing a blog post had become a matter of demonstrating my competence and a potential source of embarrassment. I felt the way that I had felt in my final year of high school as I prepared for my examinations and 'O' Levels. I gulped down two litres of water. About ten years ago, while preparing for examinations, I had done almost the same thing. My mother had exclaimed: 'I don't know why you are drinking so much water! Is it to relieve your stress?'

I did not have any idea that what I had read in the 'Not knowing' book would come to my mind as I began my confrontation with the unknown and unknowable. What was the unknown? The unknown was how to produce a public blog post. While I had blogged in the past, it had been done anonymously. I was uncertain about writing this blog post.

In the book, the authors quote Donald Rumsfeld, United States Secretary of Defense. Rumsfeld had remarked on the absence of evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq: 'There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns â€“ the ones we don't know we don't know.' Reflecting, I know that there were some things I do not know. But I realise that I have not encountered the most difficult unknown to deal with: the things that I don't know I don't know.

As I powered up my laptop, meditation instructions from my Zen meditation teacher, whom I had met only a couple of times, came to my mind: Even in a situation when the mind and your thoughts wander, count your breath. 'Counting the breath is suitable for beginners', he had explained, 'because when you realise that you have lost count, you would know that your attention has already drifted elsewhere.'

I decided to take a guerilla approach to Zen meditation and count my breath while waiting for my laptop to be ready. As I turned my attention away from the clammy sensation on my feet and my heavy and dense thoughts, towards my breath, I noticed how shallow my breaths were. I let out an exhalation and counted a few breaths. I had not even been aware that dealing with the unknown would constrict my breath in such a manner.

What is it about reading that compels people to encourage the activity?

I have been reading storybooks to keep myself company since my childhood, and I never thought too much about it; it was second nature to me. However, in writing this blog post, I drew on the investigative strength and effort of people who wrote books, such as Steven D'Souza and Diana Renner, who co-wrote 'Not knowing'. They are like a tug on your hand in pitch darkness. These are tugs that prompt a way forward when there is no light. 'Close your eyes to see,' the authors had written. I had not understood when I read the book. I had thought I had, but I had not. Now, while writing this post, I am reminded of one afternoon at a place in Singapore called Dialogue in the Dark. I had been blindfolded and led by my hand through passageways and obstacles. I was unaccustomed to the loss of my sight, and relied on my other senses and the easy banter with the person who was pulling me by the hand and guiding me. Near the end of the activity, it was revealed that my guide was blind. I was touched by this revelation and reversal of societal roles. I even teared up. In the process of writing this post,  the 'Not knowing' book had felt like the hand of the blind guide. Just as she had provided direction and company to me while I fumbled and moved in the un-seeable corridors of Dialogue in the Dark, the authors guided me as I wrote this post.

I realised that the stories of those who have gone before us can help us in unexpected ways.

This may be why storytelling is such a rich and universal tradition. This may be why reading should be encouraged among people of all ages. But in the spirit of not knowing, I may be wrong.

Even if I have become some measure of an expert while writing this post, I realised that the value of my experience is in helping others in their own experiences of the unknown. Call me naive, but I would rather somebody else go on their own journey into the unknown, than have them follow my words carelessly. I realised that a so-called expert cannot help me realise what I have to realise on my own.

Maybe, this is the value behind the authors' chapter on "Beginner's mind". If only I can confront the unknown as beginners do! If only the company of beginners can make me a beginner myself! What wouldn't I give to have the opportunity to be a beginner again and embark on the journey into the unknown once more. In a way, I'm even envious of beginners. Those who haven't walked the path have the opportunity to develop uniquely. 

Perhaps, this is my greatest value to others. Perhaps I can guide people to go on their own journeys into the unknown, so that they can develop and grow in their own unique ways. Perhaps this is the answer to the question of 'What is the meaning of life?'

But, then again, I'm no expert. I'm a beginner at blogging.

And there are others who are wiser than myself.

They may not wish to be known as experts, but when it comes to guiding people on their own journeys of 'Not knowing', Steve D'Souza and Diana Renner did well. This is my experience after reading the book.
