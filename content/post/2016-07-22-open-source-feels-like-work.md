For a given open-source software project, there will always be requests for features. There will always be bugs to fix. The question is, will there always be a developer for implementing features and bug-fixes?

I contributed to [Tatoeba](http://tatoeba.org) and [Gogs](http://github.com/gogits/gogs).

When I look at the pending feature requests for Tatoeba, it feels like work. Not fun. So I told the core developer, [Trang](http://github.com/trang), that I was going away from Tatoeba. (S)he was cool about it.

"I'll simply move you to the 'Inactive' Github team if you don't come back," she said on the [Gitter](http://gitter.im) chat.

It was cool to see my code create an impact on the Tatoeba website.

But contributing to Tatoeba is *not fun*. Not anymore. The Thais have an expression for it: *mai sanuk*.

And that's how I left Tatoeba development.
