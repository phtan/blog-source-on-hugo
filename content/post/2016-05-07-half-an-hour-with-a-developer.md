On Thursday (5 May), I went to [a Meetup for the Kx community](http://www.meetup.com/kx-singapore/events/229096747/) in Singapore. I met people who were working with software. Some of them worked at financial institutions, others at software companies. I had the opportunity to talk to a developer, whom I shall call C.

C talked about his programming projects at college, [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf), and his experience of using [the q language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28programming_language_from_Kx_Systems%29).

### How I talked

During my conversation with C, sometimes I felt like a talk show host, in the sense that I had little to no expertise in the things that C cared about. So, to compensate for my lack of expertise, I tried a style of talking that I have seen in a video clip of a conversation between two people. The video clip is as follows:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eedgLk3b9f0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To me, the video had seemed like a contrast of a positive example and a negative example of listening to people. I tried the positive example when I talked to C.

Did it work? Well, he seemed to respond enthusiastically. When I said things like 'How cool is that?' or 'That's amazing!' he replied with 'I know, right?' or 'Exactly!' He was so excited.

But I quickly ran into a problem. I wanted to go to the restroom, but I wanted to avoid sounding like the person in the video (who goes 'Pass me the butter!') Still, I excused myself in the end.

### Now what?

I will definitely try to talk in a similar manner again when I talk to another developer, if the setting is appropriate. I had seemed to be able to keep the conversation going.

Perhaps, for the purpose of professionalism, I would ask questions in the style of interviews, in future.
