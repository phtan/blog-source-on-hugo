It's 5 AM on the 3rd of May, 2016, and I am sitting for an examination in the afternoon, and I am feeling bad that my present concerns are (nothing but) my university grades and travel plans. I have watched a video on *pagpag*, a name for leftover food that is eaten in some parts of the Philippines. It is about eight minutes long. You can watch it in the player below:

I recalled a video that I had watched recently on food wastage in Singapore. Edible food is thrown into the trash because it is below aesthetic standards. The video is as below:

I thought about what I could do about the situation. What if the edible food in Singapore is channeled to the people in the Philippines? Or am I being arrogant in thinking that people who eat *pagpag* prefer something else?

It is difficult to write this post because of the complex issue of poverty, and because I'm still affected by the video on *pagpag*. I feel horrible.
