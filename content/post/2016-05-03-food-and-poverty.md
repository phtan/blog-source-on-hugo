It's 5 AM and I am sitting for an examination in the afternoon, and I am feeling bad about my present concerns of university grades and travel plans. I have watched a video on pagpag, a name for leftover food that is eaten in some parts of the Philippines. It is about eight minutes long. You can watch it in the player below:

I recalled a video that I had watched recently on food wastage in Singapore. Edible food is thrown into the trash because it is below aesthetic standards. This is the video below:

I thought about what I could do about the situation. What if the edible food in Singapore is channeled to the people in the Philippines? Or am I being arrogant in thinking that people who eat pagpag actually prefer or need something else?

It is difficult to write this post because of the complex issue of poverty, and because I'm still affected by the video on pagpag. I feel horrible.
