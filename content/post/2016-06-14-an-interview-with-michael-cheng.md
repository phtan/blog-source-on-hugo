[Michael Cheng](https://twitter.com/coderkungfu?lang=en) records videos of Meetup events and conferences. He also [trains volunteers](http://www.meetup.com/FOSSASIA-Singapore-Open-Technology-Meetup/events/229438771/) in the videography of events. He is a software engineer.

Pheng Heong snagged a chance to ask him questions at [his office](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Djangonauts/events/230920405/) in June, when he was [recording](https://engineers.sg/v/776).

*Why do you do what you do?*

It's to show what we [the developers in Singapore] are doing. It's a historical record. And the developers in Singapore are not getting any younger. They have families and they cannot attend these Meetups.

*How much money have you spent on your recording equipment?*

About a thousand dollars.

*What's the greatest difficulty that you've faced?*

It was a conference at FOSSASIA. The speaker was on a Google Hangout as he could not attend. The challenge was to record the Google Hangout and the conference itself.

*What is Meetup to you?*

It's a way of meeting new people.
